The crux of the healthcare industry is a doctor-patient relationship, patient satisfaction and care. Doctors are capable of examining 40 or more patients in a day if they don’t have to spend time on making digital records entry during or after patient interaction. Digital records regulation has put doctors under great pressure.

Imagine yourself standing in a queue for the check-up with a doctor at the hospital. Since the doctor can only handle one patient at a time, there’s a long queue of patients. You’re feeling a little anxious watching all other people around you. Finally, you enter the room and the doctor asks you questions that you answer. He listens and writes things down. During the check-up, the doctor spent a lot of time writing down notes, prescription and advice. Even after the patient exits, the doctor needs to complete the entry of the patient’s details on the system. Most of their time on an office day is spent on EHR and desk work. Abient Voice technology could help get all of this work get automated.

An electronic environment that is sensitive and responsive to the presence of people is known as Ambient Intelligence. The ambient intelligence paradigm builds upon context awareness, pervasive computing and human-centric computer interaction design. And for this, we need systems and technologies that are embedded, context-aware, personalized, and adaptive.

Devices enabled with ambient voice technology work to support people in carrying out their day to day activities in a natural way by using information and various algorithms. The devices listen to human conversation, transcribe communication and save all this information. A virtual assistant on a PC or smartphone can be set up which records the communication between patient and doctor and generates a prescription with the digital signature of the doctor. All this information is stored in the EHR format. This way the interaction of patient and doctor is completed without a single click on the system thereby reducing the doctor’s time with the system during interaction with the patient. A doctor can focus more on the patient and this, in turn, increases the number of patients examined by a doctor in a day.

To build this type of virtual assistant, we need a combination of advanced speech recognition, natural language processing and machine learning. We need to have a medical vocabulary that accurately captures the doctor’s natural verbal interaction with the patient and parses it for EHR. Also, we can use word cloud technology to give importance to the words having medical meaning. To achieve higher accuracy, human feedback can be used which can help virtual assistants train themselves faster.

This virtual assistant can be used for other healthcare specialities like internal medicine, pediatrics, orthopedics, urology, etc. due to its ambient mode. Ambient mode reduces friction as there is no need to invoke the virtual assistant with specific commands again and again. These virtual assistants can also be used during surgery to record all the communication in the surgery room.

Ambient voice technology is going to make it easier to record and access health data. Many industry experts see it as an important area for continued development to provide a hassle-free experience to clinicians and patients.
