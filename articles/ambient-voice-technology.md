The crux of the healthcare industry is the doctor-patient relationship, patient satisfaction and, care. On average, doctors are capable of examining 40 or more patients in a day if they don’t have to spend time on making digital records entry during or after patient interaction. Digital records regulation has put doctors under great pressure.

Imagine yourself standing in a queue for a check-up with a doctor. Since the doctor can only handle one patient at a time, there’s a long queue. After a while, you enter the room and the doctor asks you questions. He listens to your answer and writes things down notes, prescription and advice, spending time. Even after the patient exits, the doctor needs to complete the entry of the patient’s details on a  system. Most of their time on an office day is spent on maintaining electronic health records(EHR) and desk work. Abient Voice technology could help get all of this work get automated.

Ambient Intelligence is an electronic environment that can sense and response to the movement and actions of people around it. The ambient intelligence model builds upon pervasive computing, context awareness and human-centric computer interaction design. For this, we need technologies and computers that are context-sensitive, customizable, embedded and flexible.

Devices enabled with ambient voice technology listen to human conversation, transcribe communication and save all this information. A virtual assistant on a PC or smartphone can be set up which records the communication between a patient and a doctor, generates a prescription and saves it with the digital signature of the doctor in the EHR format. Thus, the entire interaction is completed without engaging with a system, reducing the tasks at hand for the doctor. 

To build such virtual assistants, we need a combination of advanced speech recognition, natural language processing and machine learning. We require a medical vocabulary that accurately captures the doctor’s natural verbal interaction with the patient and parses it to the EHR format. Word cloud technology can be used to give priority to words that have relevance to medicine. To train these virtual assistants and achieve to higher accuracy, human feedback can also be used.

The virtual assistants' ambient mode could bring their use to healthcare specialities like internal medicine, pediatrics and orthopedics to name a few. With ambient mode, the device is not needed to be invoked with specific commands. They could also be used during surgery to record communication in the surgery room.

Ambient voice technology is going to make it easier to record and access health data. Many industry experts see it as an important area for continued development to provide a hassle-free experience to clinicians and patients.
