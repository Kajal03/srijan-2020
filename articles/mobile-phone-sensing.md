  "We are 21st-century citizens, doing our very, very best to interact with 19th century-designed institutions that are based on an Information technology of the 15th century"  - Pia Mancini, 2014.

 The high rise of urban population and advancements in technology demand the need for smart urban cities. Smart cities use a combination of software solutions, Internet of Things (IoT) devices and user interfaces.
 
 IoT devices are a network of connected devices – such as vehicles, sensors or even home appliances. The way interaction between Web Pages (WWW) is the Internet of Content, the interaction between people (Social Media) is the Internet of People, similarly, the interaction between devices(or things) is the Internet of Things. The concept of a smart city uses IoT technologies to make better use of public resources and reduce the operational cost of public administrations, thus creating new opportunities and supporting better living.

 In the last few years, mobile phones, appliances, vehicles, and other types of devices have come equipped with sensors. Mobile devices are used daily with a very high frequency. There can be various types of sensors installed on a mobile device - from an accelerometer to gesture recognition sensors. Mobile Crowd Sensing (MCS) takes advantage of certain smartphone features such as camera, temperature monitoring, GPS and microphone to collect data from the environment. We first take a look at pollution sensing and social sensing.
 
In pollution monitoring, sensors are installed at fixed places. They continuously sense the movement of vehicles and other sources of emission of pollution around them. This is called fixed sensing. Since sensors are in place, they provide very accurate results but with a high cost.

Facebook, LinkedIn and similar other social networks have led to an increment in awareness of the power of social elements into a variety of data-centric applications. Embedding sensors in these social networks to collect a large amount of data for prediction and monitoring of applications is a natural way to enhance their power. Social sensing is qualitative but subjective. In Mobile crowdsensing, there is a huge number of sensors whose locations are not fixed. These sensors have relatively low accuracy as compared to pollution and social monitors and are used to acquire data about the user. The acquired data can be used in several applications such as determining mental health, overall wellness monitoring and noise monitoring.

Research  Question: Is mobile phone sensing an effective solution to the aggregation of urban knowledge?

Urban Scale crowdsensing is used by a large number of individuals to extract certain phenomena of interest. An experiment was conducted in France using Ambiciti - an application that notifies the user of the collective exposure to urban pollution. There are certain factors that affect efficient crowdsensing solutions. Optimizing battery and memory usage, access to sensors and network interfaces and accuracy of locations are a few of the tasks involved in enhancing the approaches of crowdsensing. Users refraining from sharing their information, or sending in fake data could produce redundancy in results.

Crowd Sensing has emerged as a powerful solution to address environmental monitoring, allowing us to control air pollution levels in crowded urban areas in a distributed, collaborative, inexpensive and accurate manner. A lot of research is going on to develop it as a significant step in the context of urban smart cities.

Mobile crowdsensing represents a very promising approach for the mobilization of citizens to improve and adapt their urban mobility. Crowdsourcing dynamic geographic information has the potential to improve various aspects of urban life.
