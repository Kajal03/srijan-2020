We all want performance from our devices and microprocessor companies are investing
billions of dollars in R&D are coming up with really innovating and revolutionary technologies
that are going to make moore's law to get to its saturation point. As more and more devices
are going hand held that companies have to decide whether to have a headphone jack or a
slightly bigger battery internal components of our devices has to be miniaturized. To tackle
this problem major microprocessor giants are coming up with new form of circuit fabrication
packaging which do not require to have discrete removable auxiliary components such as
RAM like what we have today, for example 2019 both AMD and Intel unveiled chipsets from
this paradigm, AMD called it their chiplet design and intel named it FOVEROS, which had
the codename lakefield for this. These kinds of CPU ‘s are more likely to come in HPC(high
performance computing) and server parts then in mainstream consumer market. FOVEROS
was designed to be a low power performance centric chipset. Last year Microsoft confirmed
to come equipped with this chipset in its revolutionary 2 screen folding Surface Duo. To be
honest, I think it was more of a marketing move lower the market share that Qualcomm has
with their ARM based chips like 8c X which were designed for these kind of devices Intel’s
implementation had one flaw instead of having direct interaction between the processor and
memory stacked like floors of building memory addresses and content had to be passed by
lift like pillars in the 3D packaging with one logic box layer storing content from memory in a
manner similar to buffer cache in UNIX systems but it hardly differs it from Intel’s previously
announced 2.5D technology which had video memory instead of main memory. But
nevertheless they made techies excited and motivated others in the same industry to come
up with their own implementation which at the end of the day going to make our devices
faster or I should rather say space efficient. For now what we should be excited for is have a
day and have a eco-system where we can have a set processor from different vendors that
we could stack on to one another to have better performance from those processors instead
of getting bottlenecked by caches provided by processor which is fixed for its lifecycle.
Which could seem to be a bit unbeneficial because they might lose their monopoly but this
was the main selling point for ARM processors because manufacturers had flexibility and
that is why you can never spot a homo sapien homoholding a phone that has Intel CPU, it
might have Intel’s modem (iPhones for instance) and that is why they played a great gamble
on foldable devices because they might be the next gen that people might switch to after
phones. In conclusion SOC needs to have different subsystems for encryption, modems and
so on, a space efficient technique is required otherwise cost would blow the roof. 3D
stacking could minimize the cost and help Intel gain a much needed market share in portable
devices which in a way going to help us getting a better product!
