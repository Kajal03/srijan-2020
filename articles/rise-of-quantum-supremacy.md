In the past year, we saw Google’s first proof of “quantum supremacy”. This is when a quantum computer outperforms a conventional computer.


Before we get to quantum supremacy, let me explain what a quantum computer is.
All standard computers work with quantum mechanics because their elements depend on quantum behaviour much like that of an electron. But the operations that a standard computer perform are not quantum mechanical. Standard computers store and handle information in the form of bits that can take two values - 1(up) or 0 (down).
A quantum computer, on the other hand, stores information in the form of quantum-bits or q-bits that work on any combination of Zeros and Ones. Operations on a quantum computer can then entangle the q-bits, which allows a quantum computer to solve certain problems much faster than a standard computer.


In principle, properties like conductivity, rigidity, or even colour, can be determined by looking at the atomic build-up of a molecule. But solving those equations with conventional computers would take too long. To give an idea of how much more a quantum computer can do, think about this -  one can reproduce a quantum computer on a standard computer  by numerically resolving equations of quantum mechanics, but, here's the catch, the computational difficulty of this exercise on a conventional computer increases exponentially with the number of q-bits that it is trying to reproduce.  This could perhaps be feasible with 2 or 4 q-bits on a personal computer. But, with 50 q-bits, a group of supercomputers will be required. Anything beyond 50 or so q-bits cannot presently be determined, at least not in any reasonable amount of time.

### So, what is quantum supremacy?

Quantum supremacy is the event in which a quantum computer beats the best standard computers on a specific task. It needs to be a specific task because quantum computers are special-purpose machines whose powers are realised with particular computations.

Reproducing the outcome of these computations on a standard computer would take very long. So, by letting a standard computer battle with a quantum computer on a specific task, one can show that the quantum computer does something a classical computer just can not.

The exact point at which quantum supremacy will be declared is a little ambiguous because one can always argue the alternative of using better conventional computers or better algorithms. Although, for functional purposes, this certainly doesn’t matter all that much. The fact that quantum computers can perform tasks that are difficult for a standard computer would perhaps prove the point.

### The Future of Quantum Supremacy
Quantum supremacy sounds very convincing until one realizes that most molecules have quantum processes that also surpass the computational limits of the present-day supercomputer. The creation of random variables that can be used to check quantum supremacy is not viable enough to give useful results. 

And what would it take to estimate useful results with a quantum computer?
Estimates vary between half a million and a billion, depending on just exactly what one thinks is “useful” and how optimistic they are on the prospect of improvements in algorithms for quantum computers.

When will we get to see a quantum computer with a few million q-bits?
At present, no one knows. 
The present dominant approaches like superconducting q-bits and ion traps are unlikely to scale. In neither case is there any development on how to get beyond a few hundred. This is both an engineering problem and a cost-problem.

Precisely why, in recent years, there has been a lot of discussion in the community about NISQ computers -  “noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers”. A term invented to make investors believe that quantum computing will have practical applications in the next decade or so. NISQs might soon be practically feasible, but no one knows how to calculate anything useful with them.

Personally speaking, I am doubtful that quantum computers will have practical applications soon. Quantum computing will go the same way as nuclear fusion, that it will remain forever promising but never quite work. Nonetheless, quantum supremacy is surely going to be super-exciting.
