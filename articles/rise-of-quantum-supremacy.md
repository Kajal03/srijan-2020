In the past year, we’ve seen Google’s first demonstration of ‘quantum supremacy’. To achieve supremacy, a quantum computer needs to perform any computation which for all possible purposes, a conventional computer cannot.

But before we get to quantum supremacy, let us see what a quantum computer is. Conventional computers work with quantum mechanics because their elements rely on quantum behaviour, but the operations that they perform are not quantum. They store and handle information in form of bits that can take either of two values- 1 and 0. A quantum computer, on the other hand, stores information in the form of quantum-bits or q-bits, which can be either 0 or 1, or a superposition of 0 and 1; in other words, they can be both 0 and 1 (and all points in between) at the same time. This superposition of q-bits is what gives quantum computers their intrinsic parallelism.

Q-bits represent particles (atoms, ions or electrons) and their control devices that work together to act as computer memory and a processor. These are manipulated using quantum entanglement. In quantum physics, if an outside force is applied to two atoms, it can cause them to become entangled and the second atom can take on the properties of the first one. But left alone, an atom will spin in all directions. The moment it is disrupted, it chooses one spin, and at the same time, the second atom chooses an opposite spin. Thus, it is possible to arrange two particles in a single quantum state such that when one is observed to be spin-up, the other will always be observed to be spin-down, even though it is impossible to predict the exact measurements.

In principle, properties like conductivity, rigidity, or colour, can be calculated from the atomic build-up of a molecule. But solving them with computers of today would take too long. Since quantum computers aren't limited to two states, they can solve such problems much faster. To truly realise the potential of quantum computing, consider this scenario - A quantum computer can be reproduced on a conventional one just by numerically resolving the equations of quantum mechanics. If successful, the computational complexity of the computer increases exponentially with the number of q-bits that are reproduced. On a personal computer, 2 or 4 q-bits might be feasible. For 50 q-bits, a group of supercomputers will be required and anything beyond that cannot be resolved at present, at least not in any suitable amount of time.

## What is Quantum Supremacy?

Quantum supremacy is the event in which a quantum computer outperforms the best conventional computers at a particular task. It needs to be a specific task because quantum computers are special-purpose machines designed to facilitate specific computations. This gives rise to the question - How do we test for quantum supremacy?

Scott Joel Aaronson, a professor of computer science at the University of Texas proposes that we let a quantum computer do what it does best – be itself. If set up suitably, a quantum computer will produce probabilistic distributions of measurable variables. Replicating the same on a conventional computer would take an inconveniently long amount of time, demonstrating in effect the proof of supremacy of a quantum computer.

The exact point at which quantum supremacy will be declared is a bit ambiguous because one can always argue that better traditional computers could be used, or better algorithms could be developed. But for practical purposes, this doesn’t matter all that much, since quantum computers supersede the traditional ones in terms of computational efficiency.

## The Future of Quantum Supremacy

The motivation to build quantum computers stems from the fact that most molecules have quantum processes that surpass the computational limits of present-day supercomputers. And while quantum supremacy sounds like a very promising solution, the creation of random variables that can be used to confirm quantum supremacy fails to generate any useful results. 

Does that imply that quantum computers are just new toys for scientists? And what would it take to calculate anything useful with a quantum computer? Estimates vary between half a million and a billion q-bits; depending on the subjectivity of what is deemed ‘useful’, and improvements in algorithms for quantum computers. 

When will we get to see such a quantum computer? At present, no one knows. 

Most dominant approaches, like superconducting q-bits and ion traps, are unlikely to scale. In neither case is there any development to get beyond a few hundred. To overcome the obstacles ahead, an effort is required on two fronts - research in engineering and bringing down the cost of manufacture.

This is why, in recent years, there has been a lot of talk in the community about NISQ computers, which are ‘noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers’. This is a term invented to make investors believe that quantum computing will have practical applications in the next few decades or so. The trouble with NISQs is that while it is likely that they will soon be practically feasible, no one knows how to calculate something useful with them.

Personally speaking, I am not very optimistic that quantum computers will have practical applications any time soon. I share the same scepticism for quantum computing as I do for nuclear fusion; that it will remain forever promising but never quite work. Nonetheless, quantum supremacy is surely going to be super exciting.
