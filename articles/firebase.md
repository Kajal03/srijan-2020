What is FIREBASE ?
Firebase is an open source mobile and web platform that helps you quickly develop
high-quality apps, grow your user base, and earn more money.
What this means to a developer ?
Firebase isn't just a backend as a service anymore. It's THE developer backend to
use for Google services.The new Firebase announcements made at Google I/O
2016 really make Firebase a first-class citizen in the Google ecosystem. Firebase is
bringing together all of Google's best offerings and packaging it into a clean and
easy-to-use package. You can perform various useful tasks using this.
Here is a list of the features:
➢ Realtime Database
➢ Hosting
➢ Authentication
➢ Storage
➢ Cloud Messaging
➢ Remote Config
➢ Test Lab
➢ Crash Reporting
➢ Notifications
➢ App Indexing
➢ Dynamic Links
➢ Invites
➢ AdWords
➢ AdMob
What sort of apps is Firebase good for?There’s really no limit to the types of apps that can be helped by Firebase products.
There are only limits to the platforms it can be used on. iOS and Android are the
primary targets for the Firebase SDKs, and there’s increasing support for web,
Flutter, Unity, and C++. You should also know there’s an Admin SDK available for a
variety of languages, to be used with any backend components you might require.
On top of those SDKs, there’s a library called FirebaseUI (Android, iOS, web) that
provides a bunch of helpful utilities to make development with Firebase even easier.
And there are also projects such as AngularFire that wrap the web SDKs for use with
Angular. These are open source.
