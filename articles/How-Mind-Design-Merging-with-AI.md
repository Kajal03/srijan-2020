Everyone of us, in one way or another have encountered AI at some point of life. AI or artificial Intelligence is simply intelligence dileanated by machines. We create algorithms and feed data in a machine such that it is able to take decisions according to the provided situation by using various sorts of sensors to determine its position and surroundings.
Many people are although worried that this might fire back, and the robots having AI might team up against humanity as you have seen in sci-fi movies like robot, transformers and what not. It might be the case but we need to view a broader perspective. First of all, these AI based machines are in many ways helping to improve the quality of life of humans. Just take an example of google implementing AI in AdSense, although we all hate ads intervening in our content but sometimes they can be very apt and useful.
Now, we all know that we can not use 100% of our brains at all times because of various reasons, and also our brain is sort of limits us in various aspects. So, if we are somehow able to integrate these machines powered with AI with our mind we can bring the hi-tech sci-fi future that we see in movies to reality. Some of the many perks of doing this are -
Unlimited accessible memory - At one point in life or another, we all have faced a situation where we forget stuff that is sometimes crucial. And later on we have no option other than regretting. AI could easily remind us of all such things without fail and all that regret is now gone.
Incredible processing power - Agreed that human brain is the most powerful but when distracted we can not even do basic tasks successfully. On top of it, how many of us have never used a calculator in our lives? Being honest, everyone. Just imagine a mind which could complete any sort of calculation in bare minimum amount of time. Calculators could go extinct and don’t even get me started on all the errors that would vanish.
Virtual Reality - How many have dreamt of playing on VR once? Probably many, and for those who don’t know what VR is just think of it as Jarvis of iron man coming to reality. Intriguing, right!!


Mind Control - Here comes the most interesting part. You could literally control everything with your mind. As the AI is embedded in your brain, it could interact with your brain or you could say vice versa. With just thinking, the lights of your room would go off, your pc or any machine would be switched on and you know by this point your current generation smart phones are not smart anymore...
Concluding the topic, with artificial body parts linked with your brain through the machines , many physically disabled people will get a chance to relive their lives.
All this is not just theoretical , Elon Musk , a personality everyone knows, has already started working on a neural link that is starting of this symbiosis of mind with AI.
