modems using TD-LTE technology in Kolkata, becoming the first
company in India to offer 4G services. The 4G services is much faster
than 3G and offers high-definition television streaming and video

2010 and June 2011 respectively. An entirely new category of devices
that connect users with their apps and content in a much more intimate
way than ever before.
Amazon echo and the Alexa movement - “thinks & acts intelligently”

10 years. Social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp ,
Twitter and more are providing a way to connect with each other across
distances. In addition it is becoming more expressive by introducing new
features like Boomerang, stories, IGTV etc.
Use of AirPods -“goodbye to headphone jack”
One of the most controversial innovation of the decade was the decision
by Apple in 2016 to remove the headphone jack from iPhone 7.
When they first launched in 2016 , the AirPods looked awkward but the
look eventually caught on , and Apple is on pace to sell 50 million sets of
AirPods in 2019.
Cord cutting changes TV forever -“goodbye to cable connections”
The main aim of “cutting the cord” from cable TV is to save money ,
getting away from cable connections that force us to pay extra charges
to those channels that we do not watch. As now technology has
developed and streaming boxes like Fire TV delivers better ways to
select shows to watch.

Nowadays, when we think to pay, the first thing that comes to mind is
GooglePay, Paytm etc. that have become increasingly popular due to
widespread use of online shopping and banking.
