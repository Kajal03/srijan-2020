In the last one year, Professional certification training provider Simplilearn has witnessed a 30% growth in the number of non-techies enrolled in AI, Machine Learning, Deep Learning courses. First of all, I'm making it clear that AI is a broader field and other courses mentioned above are subparts of AI. Moreover, it has been observed that Doctors of Sankara hospital in Bangalore are Using AI in screening diabetic retinopathy, age-related Macular Degeneration, and Glaucoma. In addition to this, AI is helping Businesses to find people based on their interests, demographics and other aspects to learn and detect the best audience for particular brands. Thus, Everybody whether technical or non-technical people are crazy about AI. So, I will try to answer what this AI is?
History and meaning of AI-
The term AI was given by John McCarthy in 1956. The goal of AI is to create machines that work intelligently and it tries to simulate human reasoning in machines. More Precisely saying, It is a learning machine from a given data and uses that learning to achieve specific goals and tasks. 
Why AI and what it can do-
The humans can make mistakes while calculating a result or while performing a task but machines don't if they are programmed and learned correctly. AI improves the performance of the machine with time. For example- Deep blue computer, famous for chess playing was first trained on how to play chess and then it improved its performance by learning itself with time and then defeated chess master Garry Kasparov. Performing repetitive tasks is a tedious process for humans, AI helps in doing them with perfection. Common Examples of AI that we often encounter within the day to day life are Chatbots, Window's Cortana, Google's Ok. AI is empowering many inventions in almost every domain which help human solve a majority of the complex problem.
Applications of AI-
-No matter how good programmers are, bugs are always present in their code. Here bugs mean flaw in the program that causes it to behave in an unintended way. It is a challenging task for the programmer to find and correct bugs. AI helps in doing so. Examples are - Deep code, Intellicode.
-Malware and virus attacks are common in the cyber world. There is a constant threat of data security to not just individuals or corporations but also to government sectors. AI allows automating their detection and combat without the involvement of humans.
-Companies such as General Motors, Ford, Google are working on developing autonomous cars using AI. They use a vast amount of data from image recognition systems (images from camera to identify traffic light, trees, street signs, and other parts) and neural networks (to find pattern in data) along with machine learning to learn with time.
-AI is being used to improve the education system. Traditional techniques are replaced by personalized, adaptive learning to tailor individual student strength and weaknesses to help students accomplish more
-Google's medical brain is using AI to make predictions about the likelihood of death among hospital patients. This is the latest attempt to revolutionize healthcare. These are used in diagnoses, treatment, drug development, patient monitoring, and care.
-AI is used in autonomous weapons and sensing systems enabling new military capabilities and strategies including intelligence, surveillance, and even nuclear weapon systems.
Popular AI projects
-Microsoft’s Cortana- A more intelligent and accurate assistant who can respond naturally to humans
-Google Brain- A quick messaging tool integrated into Gmail that automates common responses. 
-Google Waymo- Google’s Self-driving project using LIDAR(light detection and ranging), cameras and deep learning. 
-AlphaGo- AI project designed to play board game Go.
-Melomics- AI project to compose music without human intervention.
-Grammarly- digital writing app to make messages and documents effective and mistakes free.
Challenges in AI-
It is obvious that every technology has pros as well as cons associated with it. So, is there any downside with AI also? The answer to this is yes. Machines can perform only those tasks which it is programmed, anything out of that give irrelevant outputs which could be a major backdrop. Moreover, Its creation requires huge costs as they as complex machines and hardware and software need to get updated with time to meet the latest requirement. It is automating the majority of work which in turn making humans lazy and Increases unemployment as AI which can do similar work with more efficiency.
