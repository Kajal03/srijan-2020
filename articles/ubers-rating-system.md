Uber’s rating system has always been a mystery to most of us. Uber says they developed this system to create an environment of mutual respect between riders and drivers. I think we have all wondered at some point how this thing works, how does it affect us and is it really necessary? Let’s find out.

According to Uber, 

“After each trip, Uber riders and Uber drivers are given the opportunity to rate one another based on their trip experience – an important part of Uber customer service for both riders and drivers.”

They further mention this,

“Ratings are anonymous. Neither riders nor drivers see individual ratings tied to a particular trip or person. Candid, constructive, and respectful feedback is beneficial for everyone.”

But ask any Uber driver in india if they even consider the rating of the passenger while picking them up, and most of them will tell you that they pick up passengers without even considering their rating and even if they consider their rating, there is only a 15 second window for them to accept the ride and most of the time they have some daily quota to meet, so they really aren’t left with much choice, do they? And if you are a passenger with a high enough rating, you can easily determine which driver gave you a bad rating by seeing a drop in yours and return the favour.

So it’s totally useless, right? No, it’s not. Uber has mentioned that will start banning passengers with low ratings from its service and drivers still have a right to rate you after your trip. So, it’s just like a warning system to keep you in check.

Drivers must have it good then, you might ask? But things aren’t pretty on this side either. Their account can get deactivated or their ratings can drop if they don’t accept around 80% of their rides. They also have to keep their rating above a certain threshold or their account is at risk of getting deactivated again and to make matters worse, that threshold rating is still close to 4 stars for them!

Even though the bans and deactivation are temporary (in the worst cases, permanent) it seems pretty clear that this system isn’t benefiting anyone (except Uber, in some cases). We are lucky that this system doesn’t exist anywhere else and if Black Mirror’s season 3 episode 1 : Nosedive give any proof, we should be glad it doesn’t!
