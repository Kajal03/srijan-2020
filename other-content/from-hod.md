The developments in computer science seem to be ceaseless as evident by the phenomenon of our lives being integrated with innovation swiftly.
The products or the ideas that we have today seemed like a distant future not long ago.  And the ones that may fill some people with scepticism today might be the ones creating a revolution in research and technology tomorrow.

From Google’s push towards Quantum Supremacy to the much-hyped Blockchain and “Ethical AI”, last year has once-again been mired with buzzwords revolving around new and technologically impactful innovation. Other than elaborating on the above mentioned buzzwords, this issue of Srijan covers a diverse range of topics: it talks about the real-world impact AI is making on Healthcare, along with fundamental innovations and practical deployments such as the IPFS and SpaceX’s Starlink, which are slated to revolutionalise the internet experience for billions of users around the globe.

As a person devoted to the furtherance of the dynamicity of this field, it gives me immense pleasure to see the students not just be involved and engrossed in computer science as an academic discipline but to be actively interested in putting their thoughts, understanding, and knowledge of the latest research into words.
As responsible members of the society, it is also important to analyse and scrutinize details of every break-through that we come about. It is heartening to see the students have an independent perspective as they share their constructs.

Kudos to the authors,the editorial and the desigining team for compiling this issue. I sincerely hope that Srijan will cover contemporary topics for its readers as we move forward in this next decade.
